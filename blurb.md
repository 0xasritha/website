 Hi! This website is a record of my random projects in cybersecurity, systems, low-level programming, infrastructure, and whatever new rabbit hole I will be distracted by in the next 10 minutes. Coding until 4 AM is how I currently shut off the schizo voices in my head /s /s (not really /s). 

Beyond that, I like Monster, LEDs, and really wide monitors. I am currently 20, she/her, and unfortunatly in college atm. My lovely boyfriend works on some of the projects here with me.
